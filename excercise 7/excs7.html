  <h2> this is an h2. here are some videos from a mortician that I find interesting. </h2>
    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/syJyPq7lRGc">Video on a rugby team that was stranded in the Andes mountains for 72 days!</a>A case of cannibalism for survival. I found it to be an interesting watch.</p>
    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/3Sh06VUiXaA">Video on why JFK had a closed casket!</a> This video showcases how much of a disaster JFK's funeral process was. Like, WOW. I was surprised by how much they messed up. Like yeah the president was just killed but listen to the funeral directors bro. </p>
    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/QS299VkXZxI">Video on the whaleship Essex!</a> This is the real life story that inspired Moby Dick! Another case of cannibalism for survival. There's a nice song inspired by this event too. It's called "The Final Voyage of the Wailer's Essex" by Rusty Cage. </p>
